#Introduction
This is my build of st terminal. It patched to be effective but not cumbersome. 

It supports opening/copying links using rofi and copying previous commands. You can zoom in/out using Alt+Shift+J/K, copy and paste with Alt+c/v.

# What is ST?
As described by suckless:

> st - simple terminal
> --------------------
> st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.
> 
> 
> Requirements
> ------------
> In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.
> 
> 
> Installation
> ------------
> Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
> the /usr/local namespace by default).
> 
> Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
> necessary as root):
> 
>     make clean install
> 
> 
> Running st
> ----------

> the st terminfo entry with the following command:
